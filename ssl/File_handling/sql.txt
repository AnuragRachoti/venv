Hello world

The query you provided aims to calculate the daily admissions and the cumulative difference between consecutive days. However, there are a few issues with the SQL syntax and logic. Here's the corrected query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT
    admission_date,
    COUNT(*) AS admission_day,
    COUNT(*) - LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY admission_date) AS cumulative_difference
FROM
    admissions
GROUP BY
    admission_date
ORDER BY
    admission_date;
Explanation:
COUNT(*) counts the number of admissions for each admission_date.
LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY admission_date) calculates the count of admissions for the previous day.
The difference is calculated as COUNT(*) - LAG(COUNT(*)).
The query groups by admission_date and orders the results by admission_date.
Ensure that the admissions table has an admission_date column with date values. This query will provide you with the count of admissions for each day and the difference in admissions compared to the previous day.
