      "\n",
      "Weight - Its main function is to give importance to those features that contribute more towards the learning. It does so by introducing scalar multiplication between the input value and the weight matrix. For example, a negative word would impact the decision of the sentiment analysis model more than a pair of neutral words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transfer function - The job of the transfer function is to combine multiple inputs into one output value so that the activation function can be applied. It is done by a simple summation of all the inputs to the transfer function.\n",

      "There can be multiple interconnected hidden layers that account for searching different hidden features in the data. For example, in image processing, the first hidden layers are responsible for higher-level features like edges, shapes, or boundaries. On the other hand, the later hidden layers perform more complicated tasks like identifying complete objects (a car, a building, a person).\n",
      "\n",
      "Output Layer\n",

      "The later layers give no feedback to the previous layers. The basic learning process of Feed-Forward Networks remain the same as the perceptron.\n",

      "The basic deep learning architecture has a fixed input size, and this acts as a blocker in scenarios where the input size is not fixed. Also, the decisions made by the model were based on the current input with no memory of the past.\n",

      "In RNN each of our predictions looked only one timestamp back, and it has a very short-term memory. It doesn't use any information from further back.\n",
      "\n",
      "To rectify this, we can take our Recurrent Neural Networks structure and expand it by adding some more pieces to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The critical part that we add to this Recurrent Neural Networks is memory. We want it to be able to remember what happened many timestamps ago. To achieve this, we need to add extra structures called gates to the artificial neural network structure.\n",

      "Cell state (c_t): It corresponds to the long-term memory content of the network.\n",
      "Forget Gate: Some information in the cell state is no longer needed and is erased. The gate receives two inputs, x_t (current timestamp input) and h_t-1 (previous cell state), multiplied with the relevant weight matrices before bias is added. The result is sent into an activation function, which outputs a binary value that decides whether the information is retained or forgotten.\n",
      "Input gate: It decides what piece of new information is to be added to the cell state. It is similar to the forget gate using the current timestamp input and previous cell state with the only difference of multiplying with a different set of weights.\n",

      "\n",
      "The connectivity and weight of hidden neurons are fixed and randomly assigned. The only weight that needs to be learned is that of the output layer. It can be seen as a linear model of the weighted input passed through all the hidden layers and the targeted output. The main idea is to keep the early layers fixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only weights that will be modified during the training are for the synopsis that connects the hidden layers to the output layers. This makes the loss function simple and easy to differentiate.\n",

      "One goes through one channel at a time to detect how all the pixels in a channel are related\n",
      "The other goes through all the channels at the same time to see how one pixel is related to every other pixel that comes behind it.\n",

      "Capsule Networks\n",
      "There were some problems with Convolutional Neural Networks—\n",
      "\n",
      "They were trained to learn on images: in the lower layers and learn about edges and curvatures, and as we go up the hierarchy, it learns more complex features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sub-sampling or pooling loses spatial relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help you understand it better—\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not enough for the model to learn that the image contains a nose, eyes, or a mouth, but it should also understand that eyes are above the nose, and the nose is in between the eyes and above the mouth, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, Convolutional Neural Networks perform poorly in detecting an image in a different position, for example, rotated. It has to be in a position similar to the images they were trained on.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of invariance, the network should strive for equivariance. It means that no matter what position or rotation a subsampled image is in, the neural network responds in the same way. It should also change accordingly to adapt to such sub-images.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simple words: We need a network that is easier to generalize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the main idea—\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial Neural Networks must achieve translation rotation and invariance in a much more efficient way. These networks should have local capsules that perform complex internal computations on their inputs and then encapsulate the results into a small vector of highly informative outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, try to keep this in mind and start thinking about using a capsule instead of a neuron. Sounds interesting, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Neural Networks where instead of adding a layer, it nests a new layer inside a layer. This nested layer is called a capsule which is a group of neurons. Instead of making the structure deeper in terms of layers, a Capsule Network nests another layer within the same layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This makes the model more robust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\n",
      "Generative modeling comes under the umbrella of unsupervised learning, where new/synthetic data is generated based on the patterns discovered from the input set of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "GAN is a generative model and is used to generate entirely new synthetic data by learning the pattern and hence is an active area of AI research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\n",
      "They have two components—a generator and a discriminator that work in a competitive fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The generator’s job is to create synthetic data based on the model’s features during its learning phase. It takes in random data as input and returns a generated image after performing certain transformations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discriminator acts as a critic and has an overall idea of the problem domain with a clear understanding of generated images.\n",
      "\n",
      "These generated images are classified into fake/genuine images by the discriminator.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discriminator returns a probabilistic prediction for the images to be noisy/free-of-noise by a value in the range of 0 to 1, where 1 is an authentic image and 0 a fake image.\n",
      "\n",
      "The generator network produces samples based on its learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its adversary, the discriminator, strives to distinguish between samples from the training data and samples produced from the generator. There is feedback from the discriminator fed to the generator to improve the performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the discriminator successfully distinguishes between real and fake examples, the component is working well and no changes need to be applied to its parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The generator is given a penalty when it fails to generate an image as real such that it could fool the discriminator. However, if it succeeds in making the discriminator categorize the generated image as real, it shows that the training of the generator is moving in the right direction. So the ultimate aim for the generator is to fool the discriminator while for the discriminator is to surpass the accuracy of the generator.\n",
      "\n",

      "Transformer Neural Networks\n",
      "The truth is—\n",
      "\n",
      "RNNs are slow and take too much time in training.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are not very good with large sequenced data and lead to vanishing gradients. LSTMs that were introduced to bring memory in the RNN became even slower to train.\n",
      "\n",
      "For both RNN and LSTM, we need to feed the data sequentially or serially. This does not make use of GPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to parallelize the training on sequential data?\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is Transformers.\n",
      "\n",
      "These networks employ an encoder-decoder structure with a difference that the input data can be passed parallelly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In RNN structure, one word at a time was passed through the input layer. But in Transformers, there is no concept of timestamps for passing the input. We feed the complete sentence together and get the embeddings for all the words together.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do these Transformer Neural Networks do this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider an example of English-French translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Input Embeddings: Computers don't understand words. They understand numbers, vectors, etc. Each word is mapped with a point in space called embedding space. A pre-trained embedding space is used to map a word to a vector. The same word in a different sentence will have different meanings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Positional Encoder: Vector gives context based on the position of the word in the sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Input Embeddings + Positional Encoder = Input Embeddings with context information\n",
      "\n",
      "We pass this into an encoder block where it goes to a multi-head attention layer and a Feed-Forward layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attention layer determines what part of the input sentence the model should focus on. During the training, the corresponding French sentence embeddings are fed to the decoder that has three main components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-attention blocks generate attention vectors for every word in the sentence to represent how much each word is related to every word in the same sentence. These attention vectors and encoder’s vectors are passed into another attention block called—“encoder-decoder attention block.” This attention block determines how related each word vector is with respect to each other, and this is where English to French mapping occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A big change in the architecture was proposed -\n",
      "\n",
      "RNNs had a drawback of not using parallel computing and loss of critical information through the sequenced time stamped data. In contrast, Transformers are based on Attention that require a single step to feed all the sequential data and have a self-attention mechanism working in the core architecture to preserve important information.\n",
      "\n",
      "BERT\n",
      "\n",
      "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) outperform LSTM.\n",
      "\n",
      "These models are faster as the words can be processed simultaneously. The context of words is better learned as they can learn from both directions simultaneously. If we stack the encoders, we get the BERT model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning strategies of BERT:\n",
      "Masked Language Modeling: BERT takes input sentences and replaces some random words with [MASK] tokens. The goal of the model is to predict the original word of the masked words based on the context provided by the other, non-masked, words in the sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The model calculates the probability of each word in the vocabulary with the Softmax squashing function. It helps BERT understand the bidirectional context within a sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Sentence Prediction: In this case, BERT take the input of two sentences, and it determines if the second sentence follows the first sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This helps BERT understand context across different sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To help the model distinguish between the two sentences in training, the input is processed in the following way before entering the model:\n",
      "\n",
      "A [CLS] token is inserted at the beginning of the first sentence and a [SEP] token is inserted at the end of each sentence.\n",
      "A sentence embedding indicating Sentence A or Sentence B is added to each token. It is created to understand the correlation between the sentences.\n",
      "A positional embedding is added to each token to indicate its position in the sequence. This helps the model to understand its position when learning from both directions.\n",
      "When training the BERT model, Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction are trained together to minimize the combined loss function of the two strategies and get a good understanding of the language.\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT; GPT2; GPT3\n",
      "GPT (Generative PreTraining) is a language model used to predict the probability of the sequence of words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Language models involving generative training do not require human-labeled data.\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT-1 has two steps of training—unsupervised pre-training using unlabeled data with language model objective function followed by supervised fine-tuning of the model without a task-specific model. GPT uses transformer decoder architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "With GPT2, the purpose of the model shifted more to the text generation side. It is an autoregressive language model. It is trained on an input sequence and its target is predicting the next token at each point of the sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "It consists of a single stack of transformer blocks with an attention mechanism. It has slightly lower dimensionality than BERT, with more transformer blocks(48 blocks) and a larger sequence length.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic structure of GPT3 is similar to that of GPT2, with the only difference of more transformer blocks(96 blocks) and is trained on more data. The sequence size of input sentences also doubled as compared to GPT2. It is by far the largest neural network architecture containing the most number of parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Momentum Contrast (MoCo)\n",
      "The idea behind this model was that unsupervised pre-training could surpass the supervised counterpart in computer vision tasks like detection or segmentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, we have already seen that models like BERT, GPT that are based on unsupervised learning have been a huge success in the NLP domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In natural language processing related tasks, a model is given an input sentence and the model is required to predict one or multiple following words. Lets say we have a dictionary of all proposed words. Using such a dictionary allows us to define loss as a simple dictionary look-up problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say an image is passed through an encoder; the encoded feature of the image can be called a query.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dictionary in this case is a set of features of a large set of images. Such a dictionary is very hard to create as images and corresponding features are not readily available. A dynamic dictionary is prepared by applying the encoder model to a set of images.\n",
      "\n",
      "This methodology is called Contrastive Learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrastive learning\n",
      "The image above represents a batching perspective of two optimization mechanisms for contrastive learning. Images are encoded into a representation space, in which pairwise affinities are computed.\n",
      "\n",
      "MoCo addresses two challenges in Contrastive Learning:\n",
      "\n",
      "How to make the dynamic dictionary large enough?\n",
      "How to make the dynamic dictionary consistent when the encoder is being updated?\n",
      "To make a large dictionary in the Contrastive Learning framework, we maintain the features of the previous batch of images as a queue. The dictionary consists of current and prior batches and is not limited by the batch size.\n",
      "\n",
      "The features in this dictionary are produced by an encoder that is being constantly updated, hence reducing the overall consistency of the dictionary. To solve this consistency problem, a momentum encoder is suggested that gets slowly updated,\n",
      "\n",
      "SimCLR\n",
      "Contrastive Learning is combined with data augmentation, larger batch size, more training epochs, and wider networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "SimCLR strongly augmented the unlabeled training data and feed them to series of standard ResNet architecture and a small neural network.\n",
      "\n",
      "The images are passed to a base encoder to get embeddings. These embeddings are passed through two layers of neural networks to get another set of embeddings. A modified version of cross-entropy is used that says that similarity between two embeddings should be close if they form image and augmented image pair.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the embeddings should attract. On the other hand, the similarity between images that do not belong to the same class should repel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "Each Neural Networks architecture has its own set of pros and cons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standard Neural Networks like Feed-Forward Neural Networks are most commonly used in solving classification and regression problems related to simple structured data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent Neural Networks are much more powerful in terms of remembering information for a long time and are used in sequential data like text, audio, video etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent research shows that Transformers based on Attention Mechanism outperform RNNs and have almost replaced RNNs in every field.\n",
      "\n",
      "For complex data like images we can use ConvNets in classification tasks and for generation of images or style transfer related tasks Generative Adversarial Networks performs the best.\n",
